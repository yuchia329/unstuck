"""Demo Agent driven by Jev Ultrafast, a fast browser agent from Browser Use.

Jev works on its own, CAPTCHAs included: frames.py shows it the controls
inside frames, such as reCAPTCHA's checkbox and challenge. Jev also gets one
more operation, HIRE_HUMAN, and decides itself when to use it: after about
three failed attempts at an obstacle. It then describes the obstacle in one
sentence, the scope of the Solver's job, and its tab goes to a human Solver
through the Bridge. The Task is Solved when the CAPTCHA issues a token, or
when the Solver taps Done and Jev, looking at the page, agrees the obstacle
is gone; otherwise the Solver keeps the page. Then Jev carries on.

    TYPESAFE_API_KEY=... GEMINI_API_KEY=... npm run demo:jev

Jev drives a dedicated Chrome over CDP, launched on first use with its own
profile: Chrome's default profile asks "Allow remote debugging?" for every
connection, and the hand-off opens a second one mid-run. The Bridge is
TypeScript, so demo/jev-handoff.ts connects to that Chrome, finds Jev's tab
and calls solve() on it.

Set AGENT_URL and AGENT_TASK for another site (the task should say when to
stop), or AGENT_ASK_TASK=1 to type the task in the terminal once the page is
open, UNSTUCK_URL for another backend, TEXT_MODEL_* to use Jev's own text
model settings instead of Gemini, JEV_TRACE to a file path to save Jev's
decisions and history there.
